# TeamD_PCB

This repository contains the PCB design and control system for the BONEPARTE project's drilling subsystem. The project focuses on the development of a printed circuit board (PCB) and associated control mechanisms to support the drilling operations within the BONEPARTE system.

## Files Included:
- **Fusion_Files**: Containsschematic and board design files for the PCB.
- **Gerber_Files**: Contains Gerber files for PCB manufacturing.
- **Libraries**: Custom libraries used in the PCB design.
- **Schematic**: PDF overview the PCB design.
- **BOM**: Bill of Materials for the PCB.
- **DFM**: Design for Manufacturing document outlining manufacturing requirements.

## Installation and Usage
1. Open the Fusion 360 files to modify the PCB design.
2. Use Gerber files for manufacturing the PCB.
3. Refer to the schematic and BOM for assembly and component selection.
